# minbindjs

Minimal Javascript module to do data binding.

No need of NodeJS, Webpack or any other external dependency. Just a modern browser with Javascript modules support.

See [test1.html](test/test1.html) for a very basic example on how to do a data binding.
See [test2.html](test/test2.html) for component encapsulation.
